       			<h3>Osborne, Briley and Associates Inc.</h3> 
       			<p>"We book our inspections on-line with the client sitting in our office. Clients can see what times are available and pick what works best for them. We know instantly that we have a confirmed appointment. What a time saver!" ~ July 2005</p>

      			<h3>Richard Renk, Home Inspector</h3>
      			<p>"Scheduleze has given me my life back. It provides instant access for clients and realtors to book inspections without having to listen to voicemail or waiting for a call back. My business increased 20% in 2005 and my stress level is significantly reduced. I feel good about shutting my cell phone off while with clients knowing Scheduleze is on the job." ~ December 2004</p>

      			<h3>CW, Real Estate Agent</h3>
      			<p>"We no longer have to wait for call backs from inspectors to get an appointment. We book inspections on-line at our convenience. Very professional." ~ October 2005</p>

      			<h3>CB, Realtor</h3>
      			<p>"This software is great! Easy and fast; it makes me look great and my clients are always impressed." ~ November 2005</p>
